Keep Ya Head Up,"Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care
And I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothing, don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't trying to gas ya up, I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy? When brothers make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep your head up
Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feeling like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent
And in the end it seems I'm heading for the pen
I try to find my friends, but they're blowing in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from getting wet up
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, 'cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up
Huh, you got to keep your head up

Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

And uh, to all the ladies having babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feeling all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
'Cause ain't nothing worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feeling helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
While tears is rolling down your cheeks
You steady hoping things don't fall down this week
'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it
And don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it
And now my son's getting older and older and colder
From having the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is driving Benz
I'm still trying to hold on to surviving friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
But please, you got to keep your head up"
Temptations,"Yo Mo Bee mayn! Drop that shit!
You know what time, boo-yaow, I know it's time for you
So grab one by the hand you know what I'm sayin'
And uh, throw up that finger
Ayo throw y'all fingers up! Thug style baby, Thug style y'know?
Tell me baby are you lonely?
Don't wanna rush ya, I can help ya if ya only
Let me touch ya, if I'm wrong love tell me
'cause I get caught up, and the life I live is Hell see
I never thought I'd see, the day when I would calm down
You ain't heard, I've been known to clown and Get Around
That's my word, see you walkin' and you lookin' good
Yes indeed, got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin' me
With your attitude to match right?
Don't be phony, 'cause I hate when you act like
You don't know me I've be stressin' in the spotlight
I want the fame, but the industry's a lot like
A crap game, ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be with you every minute miss, another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand
(Look here) I wanna be an honest man
But temptations go
Throw up the finger! And all my homies go
Throw them the finger! Ya know what baby it's like
Will I cheat or will I be committed, heaven knows
Gettin' weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
In my ride and I'm all in
Gettin' high, I can hear the people callin'
I'm passin' by, everybody knows I'm ballin'
And to God, gotta keep myself from fall-in
But it's hard, all the cuties know I'm under pressure
What do I do, gettin' shaky when she pull the dress up
And say it's cool, should I stroke or should I wait a while, you decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper
Some dirty words in your ears as I kiss ya
On every curve, slow down baby don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates to your waterfall up in heaven
And don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was
Give 'em the finger!
All my homies go, throw your fingers up
That's just the Thug in me girl, you know
Peep out all my homies, y'know, it's like
A lotta people think it's easy
To settle down, got a woman that'll please me
In every town, I don't wanna but I gotta do it
The temptation got me ready to release the fluid Sensation, sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
'Cause even Thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin'
I wanna take you to the movies, and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me, in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin' you right
You're lonely and depressed you need a Thug in your life
Enough talkin', you want me to leave, I'll get to walkin'
See you later, 'cause baby I'm a player, and all I heard was

[2Pac:]
Give 'em the finger, and all my homies go
Yo this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey y'know?
Throw your fingers up
You know? They gonna peep this, this how we run game on you

(Everybody, hey, alright
Hey, heyyyeah, heyyyayy, oh)

All my niggas go, uptown in the, give 'em the finger!
Throw your hands up, give em the finger!"
God Bless The Dead,"Rest in peace to my motherfucker Biggy Smallz
That's right bwoy, it's goin on, right here
Thug Life
God bless the dead
God bless the dead, and buried
Nigga, don't worry if you see God first
Tell him shit got worse, I ain't mad
I know you representin the crew
And I can picture you in heaven with a blunt and a brew
Fuck the world, pain was a part of the game
If you a baller, money went as quick as it came
My role models - gone or they locked in the pen
Straight hustlers, caught up in the whirlwind
The other day, I thought I seen my homeboy Biggy
Sayin shit don't stop nigga no pity
We all hoods, and all we ever had was dreams
Money makin' motherfuckers plot scandalous schemes
In the gutter, you learn to have a criminal mind
I was addicted to tryin, never meant to do time
My epitaph, will read, was the last of G's
Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed
God bless the dead
Man, ain't nobody promised me a thang
I been caught up in this game
Ever since I was a little motherfucker wantin to hang
I can see 'em in my head, pow
Memories of my nigga but he dead now
Lookin back in my yearbook, all the years took
Half my peers, they're stretched for years
And if I die will they all shed tears?
Two to the dome, leave me alone, let me get my head clear
Paranoid got me lookin in the mirror
Behind me, life without my nine, I'd rather do the time
See I'm old enough to know that ain't no justice
Fuck the police and all the courts, same way they fucked us
And why the hell am I locked in jail
They let them white boys free, we be shocked as hell
In my mind I can see it comin
And all the time it's a plot to keep a nigga runnin
I keep a gun and never run unless I'm comin at ya
Cry later but for now let's enjoy the laughter
God bless the dead
Rest in peace to all the motherfuckers that passed too early
All the young motherfuckers that was took in they prime
Real motherfuckin G's, this one is for you
"
Hail Mary,"Makaveli in this, Killuminati
All through your body
That blows like a 12-gauge shotty, feel me!
And God said he should send his one begotten son
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me! Eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh!
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words being quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hopin' that he's listenin'
Seein' niggas comin' for me
Through my diamonds, when they glistenin'
Now pay attention: bless me please, Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit
Plus, mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, hail Mary
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realize the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile
We're too crazy to be humble; we ballin'
Catch me, father, please, ‘cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy, I hear you callin', can I get some more?
Hell, 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?
One life to live, but I got nothin' to lose
Just me and you on a one-way trip to prison, sellin' drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin', life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doin' their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart; now hail Mary, nigga!
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?"
Me Against The World,"It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose, it's just me against the world
Stuck in the game
Me against the world, baby
Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is on top of me
The projects is full of bullets, though bodies is droppin'
They ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings
Leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children 'cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard headed bastard
Maybe he'll listen in his casket; the aftermath
More bodies being buried, I'm losin' my homies in a hurry
They're relocatin' to the cemetery
Got me runnin', stressin', my vision's blurry
The question is will I live? No one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feeling this anger
Don't wanna make excuses, cause this is how it is
What's the use? Unless we're shootin' no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world, baby
With all this extra stressin'
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this oppression?
They punish the people that's askin' questions,and those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons
Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings, don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothin' like the game, it's just me against the world
Hahaha, that's right
I know it seem hard sometimes
But uh, remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get
Stick your chest out, keep your head up, and handle it!"
How Do You Want It,"I love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a brother wantin' it so bad, I'm about to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me but I can't comprehend the meanin'
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can
Forgive me I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International, player with the passport
Just like Aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me - Champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin' baby I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, nigga, now tell me how you want it
Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk?
Am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor
It's like erotic
Ironic, cause I'm somewhat psychotic
I'm hittin'' switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster
I'm up inside ya, I ain't quittin' 'til the show is over
Cause I'm a rider, in and out just like a robbery, I'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me
Get her rockin' these
Nights full of Alize
A livin' legend you ain't heard about
These niggas play these Cali days
C. Delores Tucker, you's a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga you destroy a brother
Worse than the others; Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, nigga, top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell - only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' about us I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss
Nigga, tell me how you want it
Raised as a youth
Tell the truth, I got the scoop
On how to get a bulletproof
Cause I jumped from the roof
'fore I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I'm livin' major - my adversaries
Is lookin' worried, they paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gonna see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin' fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me
But I'ma mash out and peel out
I’m with a clique that’s quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it
When you see me, tell a nigga how you want it
How do you want it?"
So Many Tears,"I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven
Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dying breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can you feel me
I'm not living in the past, you wanna last?
Be the first to blast Remember Kato
No longer with us; he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets, now rest in peace
Is there heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears
I! I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...
Lord! I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Now that I'm struggling in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world cause I'm cursed, I'm having visions
Of leaving here in a hearse, God can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again, I'm going blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't living well
I know my destiny is Hell. Where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears
Lord! I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...
Lord! I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer
To embrace an early death, now there's nothing left
There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest
I'm barely standing, bout to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons trying to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparking the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Painting a picture of my enemies killing me, in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the mornin' to see the sun
Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come
Lord! (God!), I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...
God! I lost so many peers
And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-bys takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, getting high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to getting crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wanting babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearing noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin' to the floor; beggin' for the Lord to let me in
To Heaven's door -- shed so many tears
Lord! lost so many peers, and shed so many tears...
I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears...
Lord! I suffered many years, and shed so many tears...
God! I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears"
Unconditional Love,"Unconditional Love (no doubt)
Talking bout the stuff that don't wear off
It don't fade
It'll last for all these crazy days
These crazy nights
Whether you wrong or you right
I'm a still love you
Still feel you
Still there for you
No matter what (hehe)
You will always be in my heart
With unconditional love
Come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings
All my peers doing years beyond drug dealing
How many caskets can we witness
Before we see it's hard to live this life without God, so we must ask forgiveness
Ask mama why I got this urge to die
Witness the tears falling free from my eyes, before she could reply
Though we were born without a silver spoon
My broken down TV, show cartoons in my living room (hey)
One day I hope to make it, a player in this game
Mama don't cry, long as we try, maybe things change
Perhaps it's just a fantasy
A life where we don't need no welfare and share with our whole family
Maybe it's me that caused it, the fighting and the hurtin'
In my room crying cause I didn't want to be a burden
Watch mama open up her arms to hug me
And I ain't worried bout a damn thang, with unconditional love
In this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
Just got the message you've been calling all week
Been out here hustling on these streets, ain't had a chance to speak
But you know, with you and me it's on G
We could never be enemies
Cause you been such a good friend to me
Where would I be without my dogs
No wonder why when times get hard
Cause it ain't easy being who we are
Driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions
So I proceed to make Gs, eternally in my mission
Is to be more than just a rap musician
The elevation of today's generation, if could make 'em listen
Prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed
Time to plan, strategize, my family's gotta eat
When we make something out of nothing
No pleasure in the suffering, neighborhood would be good
If they could cut out all the busting
The liquor and the weed the cussing
Sending love out to my block
The struggle never stops (unconditional love)
In this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
I'll probably never understand ya ways
With everyday I swear I hear ya
Trying to change your ways while getting paid at the same time
Just had a baby with the same eyes
Something inside, please let me die these are strange times
How come I never made it
Maybe it's the way I played it in my heart
I knew one day I gotta be a star
My hopes and all my wishes
So many vivid pictures, and all the currency
I'll never even get to see
This fast life soon shatters
Cause after all the lights and screams
Nothing but my dreams matter
Hoping for better days
Maybe a peaceful night, baby don't cry
Cause everything gonna be alright
Just lay your head on my shoulder
Don't worry bout a thing, baby
Girl I'm a soldier (huh)
Never treated me bad, no matter who I was
You still came with that, unconditional love"

Cause even when I'm high, fuck with me and get crossed later
The futures in my eyes, cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-oh Benz flauntin' flashy rings, uh
Bitches pursue me like a dream
Been know to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's gettin' jealous, and motherfuckers die
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
We got four niggas, in low riders, and ski masks

Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile callin' big shots on the scene major
Packin' hundreds in my drawers; fuck the law

Catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane

Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live my life as a boss playa, cause even gettin' high
These niggas got me tossin' shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz, burnin' rubber

Y'all got me under surveillance, huh
All eyes on me, but I'm knowin'"
Trapped,"You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
Happiness, living on the streets is a delusion
Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
Shot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought
Nine millimeter kickin' thinkin' about what the streets do to me
'Cause they never talk peace in the black community
All we know is violence, do the job in silence
Walk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
Too many brothers daily heading for the big pen
Niggas comin' out worse-off than when they went in
Over the years I done a lot of growin' up
Getting drunk, throwin' up
Cuffed up
Then I said I had enough
There must be another route, way out
To money and fame, I changed my name
And played a different game
Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
If one more cop harasses me I just might go psycho
And when I get 'em, I'll hit 'em with the bum rush
Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
Yo, if you're smart you'll really let me go, G
But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the Uzi
They got me trapped
Uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
They got me trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down
Trapped
Uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
Trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down
They got me trapped
Can barely walk the city streets
Without a cop harassing me, searching me
Then asking my identity
Hands up, throw me up against the wall
Didn't do a thing at all
I'm telling you one day these suckers gotta fall
Cuffed up throw me on the concrete
Coppers try to kill me
But they didn't know this was the wrong street
Bang, bang, count another casualty
But it's a cop who's shot for his brutality
Who do you blame? It's a shame because the man's slain
He got caught in the chains of his own game
How can I feel guilty after all the things they did to me?
Sweated me, hunted me
Trapped in my own community
One day I'm gonna bust
Blow up on this society
Why did ya lie to me?
I couldn't find a trace of equality
Work me like a slave while they laid back
Homie, don't play that
It's time I let 'em suffer the payback
I'm trying to avoid physical contact
I can't hold back, it's time to attack jack
They got me trapped
Uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
They got me trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down
Trapped
Uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
Trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down
Now I'm trapped and want to find my getaway
All I need is a 'G' and somewhere safe to stay
Can't use the phone
'Cause I'm sure someone is tapping in
Did it before
Ain't scared to use my gat again
I look back in hindsight the fight was irrelevant
But now he's the devil's friend
Too late to be tellin' him
He shot first and I'll be damned if I run away
Homie is done away, I should've put my gun away
I wasn't thinking, all I heard was the ridicule
Girlies was laughin', Tup saying, ""Damn homies is dissing you.""
I fired my weapon
Started steppin' in the hurricane
I got shot so I dropped
Feelin' a burst of pain
Got to my feet
Couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
Now I'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
Ran through an alley
Still lookin' for my getaway
Coppers said, ""Freeze, or you'll be dead today.""
Trapped in a corner
Dark and I couldn't see the light
Thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life
What do I do? Live my life in a prison cell?
I'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell
They got me trapped
Uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
They got me trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down
Trapped
Uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
Trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down"
Life Goes On,"How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
As I bail through the empty halls, breath stinkin' in my jaws
Ring, ring, ring, quiet y'all, incoming call
Plus this my homie from high school, he's getting by
It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry
Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls
We used to do them as adolescents, do you recall?
Raised as G's, loc'ed out and blazed the weed
Get on the roof, let's get smoked out and blaze with me
2 in the morning and we still high assed out
Screaming ""thug till I die"" before I passed out
But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone
Thinking I don't wanna die all alone, but now ya gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death, I'm drinkin' Hennessy
While trying to make it last
I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed
Cause life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, and life goes on
Yeah nigga, I got the word is hell
Ya blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time, won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict that's getting old
Plus with the drama we're looking out for your baby's mama
Taken risks, while keeping cheap tricks from getting on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gaming on dumb hotties at yo' parties
Me and you, no truer two
While scheming on hits
And getting tricks that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried. Rest, nigga, cause I ain't worried
Eyes blurry saying goodbye at the cemetery
Though memories fade
I got your name tatted on my arm
So we both ball till my dying days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental rest in peace. Thug till I die!
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on

Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
Bury me smiling with G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it
Let the hoes that I used to know
From way before kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen so I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of gin in case I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die, we outlaws, let me ride
Until I get free, I live my life in the fast lane
Got police chasing me
To my niggas from old blocks, from old crews
Niggas that guided me through back in the old school
Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies
See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me
And brothers, miss ya while your gone
You left your nigga on his own. How long we mourn?
Life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Life goes on homie
Gone on, cause they passed away
Niggas doing life, niggas doing 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel ya, nigga. Trust me, I feel ya
You know what I mean
Last year we poured out liquor for ya
This year nigga, life goes on
We're gonna clock now
Get money, evade bitches, evade tricks, give playa haters plenty of space, and basically just represent for you baby
Next time you see your niggas, you're gonna be on top, nigga
They're gonna be like, ""Goddamn, them niggas came up""
That's right, baby, life goes on and we up out this bitch
Hey Kato, Mental
Y'all niggas make sure it's poppin' when we get up there man
Don't front
Life goes on
Hold me no more hold me no more
Yes it do yes it do yes it do"

Trying to come up off of me, you in the clouds hoping
Smoking dope, it's like a sherm high
Niggas think they learned to fly
But they burn, motherfucker, you deserve to die
Talking about you getting money, but it's funny to me
All you niggas living bummy – why you fucking with me?
I'm a self-made millionaire
Thug livin', out of prison, pistols in the air haha
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it and smiled
Now I'm back to set the record straight
With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Motherfucker, I'll hit 'em up
Now you tell me who won
I see them, they run haha
They don't wanna see us
Take money
Whole Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique dressing up trying to be us
Take money
How the fuck they gonna be the mob when we always on our job? We millionaires
Killing ain't fair, but somebody got to do it
Oh yeah, Mobb Deep: you wanna fuck with us?
You little young-ass motherfuckers
Don't one of you niggas got sickle-cell or something?
You're fucking with me, nigga
You fuck around and catch a seizure or a heart attack

This is how we do it on our side
Any of you niggas from New York that want to bring it:
Bring it!
But we ain't singing, we bringing drama
Fuck you and your motherfucking mama

Now when I came out, I told you it was just about Biggie
Then everybody had to open their mouth with a mother fucking opinion
Well, this is how we gonna do this:

And if you want to be down with Bad Boy, then fuck you too!

Fuck 'em, we Bad Boy-killers

Troublesome '96,"Troublesome, nigga
Hahaha, troublesome 19-motherfucking-96
(Westside!) Let it be known, nigga!
Boss of all bosses, Makaveli
Menacin' methods, label me a lethal weapon
Making niggas die witnessin' breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan?
To be the man in this wicked land
Underhanded hits are planned
These Scams are plotted over grams and rocks
Outlaw motherfuckers die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends; fuck friends and foes!
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Got me a dog and named her my ""bitch nigga eater""
What could they do to me, you lil' brat?
Shit, them niggas that shot me is still terrified I'll get they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside?
We Outlawz, motherfuckers can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit, but that's after I'm gone
'Cause they fear me in my physical form
Let it be known I'm troublesome
Troublesome nigga, Outlawz
Put it down to the fullest
Spittin' rhymes and bullets, ha ha
We troublesome
Y'all know what time it is
Call the punk police, they can't stop us
Niggas run the streets, we troubleshit
Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
We guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor, bet I bomb on first
Niggas knew we came for murder, pullin' up in a hearse
Westside was the war cry, bustin' off freely
Screaming, ""Fuck all ya'll niggas!"" in Swahili
Pistol packin', fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on yo' ass like an avalanche
A sole survivor, learned to get high and pull drive-by's
Murder my foes, can't control my 9
Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin' please
Busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee
Picture me lettin' this chump survive; ran up on his ass
When I dumped he died, 'cause I'm troublesome
Young, strapped, and I don't give a fuck – I'm hopeless
I live the Thug Life, losin' my focus, ba-baby
I'm troublesome, haha
Bad Boy killa, there is no one realer
What you saw was the rough, rugged and raw – Outlaw!
""Murder murder"" my mind state, shit ain't changed
Since my last rhyme – the crime rate ain't decline
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost they mind
Like 25 to life never crossed they mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen 'cause he yearned to bang
Sent a lot of flowers, but how could I cry
Tried to warn the little nigga, ""Either stop or die""
Mercy is for the weak, when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep; I'm having crazy dreams
Vivid pictures of my enemies, family times
God to forgive me 'cause it's wrong, but I plan to die
Either take me in Heaven and understand I was a sheep
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to Hell, 'cause I ain't begging for my life
Ain't nothing worse than this cursed-ass hopeless life
I'm troublesome
In your wildest dreams you couldn't picture a nigga like me
Hahahaha – I'm troublesome, I don't give a fuck
I'm troublesome… like my nigga Napoleon said, nigga
Somebody gotta explain why I ain't got shit
Ha ha, I'm troublesome
You know what time it is, the Outlaw clique
Young rugged and sick
Makaveli the Don, the Boss of all Bosses
Mussolini, E.D.I. Amin, Hussein Fatal
Kadafi, Kastro, Napoleon, Po-Nitty
Haha, we ain't fuckin' around
Haha, we Troublesome
Ayo, haha, we Troublesome, I ain't going, HA HAH
Young Kastro, the first to blast, the last one to dash
Going for the hoes and the cash
Fuck you niggas! Outlawz! Ha hah!
Khadafi – trump tight, never sloppy
Them motherfuckers try to copy
But they can't mock you, nigga, you're too strong
Outlawz keep it going on, you know whassup
Outlawz, Outlawz, all you niggas die
Outlawz, Outlawz
This is dedicated to the real niggas
All the real troublesome soldiers on the streets
…bye bye, bye bye, all you niggas die…"
I ain't Mad At Cha,"Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggas to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit 'cha
I ain't mad at 'cha
Got nothin' but love for ya, do your thing, boy
Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'mma send this one out for y'all, know what I mean?
Cause I ain't mad at 'cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there, kickin' up dust
Givin' a motherfuck
Yeah, niggas
Cause I ain't mad at 'cha
Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line 
You was just a little smaller but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
'member when you had a Jheri Curl didn't quite learn
On the block, wit'cha Glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed
Oh you's a Muslim now? No more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the Mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large you tell me it's trouble
Congratulations on the wedding, I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd BOMB
on the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, cause I'm just laughin' at 'cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go ahead
Cause I ain't mad at 'cha
(Hmm, I ain't mad at 'cha)
We used to be like distant cousins
Fightin', playin' dozens, whole neighborhood buzzin'
Knowin' that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides, bumpin' 'n grindin' wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time we'd learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state
I kiss my momma, goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, cause momma I ain't happy here
I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin' mad
I'm knockin' busters on they backs, in my cell, thinkin'
""Hell, I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at 'cha
Cause you's a down ass bitch and I ain't mad at 'cha
Well guess who's movin' up, this nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothing to lots, ten carats to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
He's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's
Most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb hopin' we make it, to the better days
Cause crime pays and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?
'Til God return me to my essence
Cause even as an adolescent, I refuse to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at 'cha
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at 'cha"
Changes,"I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself:
""Is life worth living? Should I blast myself?""
I'm tired of being poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm looking for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
""Give the crack to the kids: who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare!""
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
""It's time to fight back,"" that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start making changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change... and that's the way it is
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right
'Cause both Black and White are smoking crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact:
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way, but you staying in the dope game
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Being real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way
Selling crack to the kids
""I gotta get paid!"", well hey, but that's the way it is
We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start making some changes
Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wasn't working
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive
And still I see no changes
Can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts giving it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool
You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Coming back after all these years
""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat!"" That's the way it is"
California Love,"Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreaming
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearing hoochies screaming
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of a Westside player where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearing Chucks not Ballys (yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossing, but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we program
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam, it's Westside
So you know the row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down
Give me love!"
