    "# Spotting Trending Topics in Scientific Research with Latent Dirichlet Allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "For this week's challenge I decided to spend some time finding a novel text dataset and dabbling in a little data mining. After bumming around the internet for a while I found my target: **Nature.com**\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as I know nature.com does not provide any API service for programmatically accessing their content. While they have been nice enough to make some papers \"open access\", which means they are free to download as a PDF or view in browser as html, there's no way I am gonna point click drag copy paste through a hundred webpages to get the volume of data I would like for this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, python is good for more than data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "And with a url as straight forward as this\n",
    "\n",
    "`https://www.nature.com/search?article_type=protocols,research,reviews&subject=biotechnology&page=3`\n",
    "\n",
    "who needs an api???\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two python files in this directory that scraped research papers off nature.com for use in the this notebook's dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [first script](https://github.com/NoahLidell/math-of-intelligence/blob/master/generative_models/collect-article-html.py), `collect-article-html.py`, plugs different [keywords](https://www.nature.com/subjects) in the `&subject=` placeholder in the url and goes through the first eight pages of search results. Each search result page's html is loaded into an html parser (lxml) and the link and title for all 25 articles on the results page is accessed through the xpath for the respective html elements. The article links gathered are followed and the raw page html for the research paper document is saved in a database (mysql) along with the articles' title, date, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "I ran this `collect-article-html.py` repeatedly across 32 different searchable keywords and in a few hours pulled down over 3000 research papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [second script](https://github.com/NoahLidell/math-of-intelligence/blob/master/generative_models/process-html.py), `process-html.py`, pulls the raw html from the db for every article downloaded. Filtering the research paper text out of the html document proved easier than I expected. I used the BeautifulSoup4 library to removal all the html tags and then with just the page text leftover it was as easy as telling python to only keep the text after the \"Abstract\" substring and before the \"References\" substring. Additional text preprocessing was done in this script, removing all special characters, numbers, and excess whitespace.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I dumped all of the article text data out of mysql and into a sqlite database file for this notebook to pull its data from. The sqlite db is over 100MB so I couldn't upload it directly to github. If you trying to run this notebook, you'll need to unzip the `article_db.zip` file in this directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was motived to compile this dataset since I believe the machine learning isn't the only discipline where interesting things are happening right now. What about CRISPR? What about quantum computing? What about nano technology? I don't know anything about those topics, but they seem interesting... So this notebook is my attempt to gather and explore data on current research across a variety of fields, using LDA as a method for identifying keywords and topics within larger fields such as biotechnology and physics.

      "\n",
      "\t near infrared nir induced chemothermal doxorubicin dox release for anticancer activity was demonstrated using dox incorporated fully lateral nanodimensional graphene oxide ngo flakes layered with chitosan polyethylene glycol peg conjugate ngo dox cpeg from a single pass gas phase self assembly unlike most previously reported graphene oxide based drug carriers the proposed processing method introduced a fully nanoscale both in lateral dimension and thickness configuration without multistep wet physicochemical processes that enhance the drug loading capacity and nir induced heat generation resulting from the increased surface area the accumulation of ngo dox cpeg flakes in prostate cancer cells enhanced apoptotic phenomena via the combined effects of dox release and heat generation upon nir irradiation the combined anticancer effects were verified through in vivo assessment with better safety profiles than free dox the proposed strategy warrants continuous assembly of multimodal nanocarriers for the efficient treatment of prostate cancers and may be a promising candidate for advanced drug delivery systems top of page introduction chemotherapy for cancer treatment has several serious limitations such as toxicity cancer recurrence and drug resistance thus realizable alternative therapeutic approaches must be developed to secure their efficacy and safety in the past years tremendous efforts have been undertaken to utilize nanotechnology based drug delivery systems to resolve these issues and improve the therapeutic efficacy for optimal cancer treatments drug release in combination with hyperthermia therapy can efficiently kill cancer cells in a specific tumor region thereby minimizing damage to normal healthy tissues near infrared nir laser irradiation can penetrate into deeper tissue layers without any damage to cells because of its wavelength range nm this property can be utilized on tumor targeted carbon or gold based nanomaterials which can efficiently absorb nir for cell death induction via hyperthermia therapies in the localized irradiation area graphene oxide go has recently been used as a promising carbonaceous material for photo assisted therapeutic applications go has been used for biosensor and diagnostic applications because of its excellent physical and chemical properties for example high electrical conductivity strength and large surface area for drug loading two dimensional go flakes possess great potential for enhanced drug delivery through conjugation with proteins fluorescent probes drugs and protective coatings to their surface available functional groups as a complementary means polyethylene glycol peg incorporation with graphenes has been found to effectively kill cancer cells with minimum adverse effects for practical applications in drug delivery systems the lateral dimension thickness and shape of go flakes can potentially affect the therapeutic outcomes cellular uptake of exogenous species smaller than m generally occurs through endocytosis caveolae or clathrin mediated otherwise cellular uptake occurs via phagocytosis or micropinocytosis a previous report explored size dependent internalization of go and the results suggested that controlling lateral dimensions may optimize therapeutic efficacies however the incorporation of drugs and or biofunctional coatings on go surfaces generally requires multiple preparation steps and tedious chemical reactions and separations therefore simple continuous and efficient methodologies for the on demand fabrication of go based biofunctional platforms are necessary securing a fully lateral nanodimensional both the lateral dimension and thickness configuration may enhance cellular internalization to introduce beneficial biomedical applications in this study we designed and prepared a novel system to self assemble fully lateral nanodimensional go ngo incorporated doxorubicin dox ngo dox flakes in a single pass

supplementary table s the geometric mean diameter geometric s d and total concentration of the ngo flakes were nm and cm respectively and nm and cm respectively for the dox particles the ngo dox flakes were larger than individual ngo flakes because of the deposition of dox components on ngo surfaces during solvent extraction from the hybrid droplets figure the significant changes in mechanical properties such as pressure velocity and density were caused by the hybrid droplets that passed through the atomizer orifice which may redistribute the dox particles on ngo surfaces and result in no significant size increases of ngo flakes after dox incorporation there were no newly formed peaks that is multimodal size distribution the distribution followed that of individual ngo rather than dox which indicated that the concentration of ngo flakes was sufficient to support self assembly of all the dox particles figure particle size distributions of nanodimensional graphene oxide ngo incorporated doxorubicin dox ngo dox flakes including individual ngo flakes and dox particles full figure and legend k physicochemical characterizations of the ngo dox flakes were performed as shown in supplementary figure s digital images of the ngo dox and ngo dox dispersions suggested feasibility in single pass loading of dox on ngo flakes through visual inspection red color of dox in supplementary figure sa uv vis spectroscopy was applied to confirm dox loading on the ngo flakes supplementary figure sb a strong absorption peak at nm and shoulder peak at nm for ngo corresponded to transitions and n transitions of the c c and c o groups respectively and these peaks verified the gas phase synthesis of ngo dox possesses a characteristic max at nm this peak was also observed in the ngo dox dispersion thereby supporting that dox incorporation with ngo flakes did not change the optical properties of the ngo no significant peak changes at and nm fourier transform infrared measurements were performed as presented in supplementary figure sc the ngo flakes presented characteristic peaks at and cm for c o bending c o stretching in carboxyl groups c o stretching vibration in hydroxyl groups and o h stretching respectively the characteristic dox peaks appeared from to cm representing the anthracene nucleus and molecular bone vibration of dox at cm accompanied with nh and oh stretching vibrations at and cm respectively these characteristic ngo and dox peaks were evident in the ngo dox flakes suggesting their quantitative incorporation during self assembly the ee and lc of dox on ngo flakes were determined using high performance liquid chromatography supplementary figure sd high ee and lc of dox were observed and these values were attributed to a strong interaction between the ngo surfaces and dox molecules caused by a large surface area supplementary figure s for the loading textural property measurements revealed that the adsorbed nitrogen volume of ngo was significantly larger than that of commercial lateral microdimensional go m lateral dimension inset of supplementary figure s the specific surface area m g and pore volume cm g of our ngo were larger than those of microdimensional go flakes m g and cm g which were examined using a porosimeter asap micromeritics inc supplementary information this implied that ngo may be more suitable for high drug loading in go based drug delivery applications to enhance the dispersion stability cpeg was incorporated with ngo dox flakes to prepare the ngo dox cpeg flakes for appropriate chemothermal anticancer assessments dox covered the oxygen containing functional groups oh cooh and c o on ngo surfaces that are responsible for maintaining aqueous dispersibility importantly this incorporation can minimize macrophage opsonization and increase the blood circulation time for efficient delivery to the tumor area on the basis of the zeta potential measurements w w was chosen for effective capping of the ngo dox flakes because the charge reversal was maximized at this condition no significant increases in positive potential were noted above this level supplementary figure sa the negative potentials of ngo flakes decreased upon dox incorporation because dox passivates the oxygen containing functional groups on the ngo flakes furthermore the amine groups in dox may neutralize the negative charges on ngo surfaces supplementary figure sb cpeg incorporation further changed the zeta potential of ngo dox flakes to positive polarity which may be due to the additional incorporation of amine groups from the chitosan matrix the effects of cpeg incorporation on the ee and lc of dox were also evaluated supplementary figure sc a slight decrease in the ee and lc was observed which possibly resulted from the sonication used for cpeg incorporation which caused partial detachment of dox from the ngo surfaces most of the dox remained on the ngo surfaces even after sonication because of electrostatic attraction and capillary forces between ngo and dox increasing the surface area by decreasing the lateral dimension of the go flakes may increase the forces that maintain the high ee and lc of dox on go flakes the dispersibility of ngo dox and ngo dox cpeg flakes was observed using digital imagery as presented in supplementary figure sd fourier transform infrared analyses presented the appearance of the characteristic cpeg peaks in ngo dox cpeg flakes suggesting incorporation of the ngo dox flakes and cpeg components supplementary figure se the ngo dox flakes showed agglomeration and caused instability that was moderated via cpeg incorporation which passivated the surfaces of the ngo dox flakes to introduce electrostatic repulsive forces between the same polarity surfaces maintaining the stability for long term storage supplementary figure s this phenomenon may offer a useful protocol for using gas phase assembled drug loaded nanoplatforms for practical delivery applications to clarify the fully nanodimensional characteristic morphological analyses of the ngo and ngo dox cpeg flakes were performed using transmission electron microscopy figure a and atomic force microscopy figure b the analyses showed that the lateral dimension of single ngo and ngo dox peg flakes ranged from to nm nm in thickness supplementary figure s which was consistent with the sizes determined through dynamic light scattering nm however these sizes were smaller than those from scanning mobility particle sizer measurements figure because the particle diffusion coefficients in the gas phase were three orders of magnitude larger than those encountered in the liquid phase thereby leading to agglomeration that is making some connections between single flakes figure a and b between flakes in the gas phase the drug release profiles figure c of dox from ngo dox cpeg flakes under different ph conditions were evaluated using dialysis drug release was significantly higher under acidic conditions than under normal physiological ph which favored tumor targeted dox release protonation of dox under acidic conditions resulting in a more hydrophilic form might have led to this result effects of nir irradiation on temperature changes in ngo and ngo dox cpeg dispersions were evaluated as presented in figure d go can increase temperature by energy transfer through network restoration mediated light absorption to heat the temperature increase patterns of the two dispersions were similar during nir irradiation min and the local temperature reached c for ngo dox cpeg flakes this temperature increase may lead to combined anticancer activity with dox figure a transmission electron microscopy and b atomic force microscopy images of ngo and

cpeg chitosan polyethylene glycol dox doxorubicin ngo nanodimensional graphene oxide full figure and legend k we investigated the chemothermal effects of go dox cpeg flakes on prostate cancer cells pc du and lncap cells as presented in figure a even though the go cpeg flakes did not show significant effects in killing the cancer cells nir irradiation on the flakes resulted in an increase in the number of dead cells with dox treatment of cells were damaged and recorded as dead and these cells were increased by when treated with go dox cpeg flakes this scenario may be due to a roll up effect of ngo flakes the reduction in total free energy due to interaction existing in the overlap region of the ngo flakes in the present case figure a and b the lateral dimension of single ngo flakes decreased upon incorporation of dox cpeg through interaction between ngo and dox cpeg this interaction may enhance the flakes that enter cells for targeted dox release the cellular uptake of ngo dox cpeg flakes in prostate cancer cells is presented in figure b the ngo dox cpeg flakes were efficiently uptaken in the lysosomes of all the prostate cancer cells lysosomes which exist at ph could assist in dox release inside the cells for targeted therapy quantitative cellular uptake of ngo dox cpeg flakes was performed using fluorescence activated cell sorting figure c in all three cell lines ngo dox cpeg flakes were uptaken in a concentration and time dependent manner these results support further investigation of the flakes for in vivo study figure a viabilities of pc du and lncap cells

apoptotic effects of ngo dox cpeg flakes as a result of chemothermal effects in prostate cancer cells are presented in supplementary figure sa consistent with the mts assay results analysis of apoptosis revealed better effects of ngo peg flakes upon nir irradiation dox treatment has more apoptotic cells because of its known anticancer effects this effect was further improved in the case of dox incorporation with ngo flakes as evidenced by the increase in the number of cells in the late apoptotic region this result was further improved by a hyperthermia effect of ngo flakes caused by prolonged nir irradiation for min these results were confirmed by western blot analyses supplementary figure sb compared with free dox enhanced expression of different pro apoptotic proteins such as bax p p and c caspase proved the effectiveness of ngo dox cpeg flakes for tumor specific delivery mediated by lysosomes nir irradiation maximized their expression levels and supported the combined hyperthermia effect of ngo flakes for antitumor therapy the cytotoxicities of free dox ngo cpeg and ngo dox cpeg with or without nir irradiation were evaluated via live dead assay with pc du and lncap cell lines figure a as expected the free dox treatment introduced a significant cell death as indicated by red dots the ngo cpeg flakes exhibited only a small number of dead cells from the treatment and nir irradiation introduced slight increases in cell death for all the cell lines because of the added dox ngo dox cpeg flakes showed a significantly larger number of dead cells than the ngo cpeg flakes nir irradiation introduced further increases in cell death implying that the photoinduced temperature increase of ngo flakes can effectively accelerate the induction of cellular apoptosis this may be due to a synergistic effect of photothermal cell killing and dox release acceleration suggesting that dox cpeg incorporation with ngo flakes would be a suitable formulation for chemothermal cancer therapy cell cycle analyses were used to validate the synergistic effect of ngo dox cpeg flakes with or without nir irradiation on the cell lines figure b the untreated groups presented cells in different phases g s g and m of the cell cycle treatment with ngo cpeg flakes did not significantly alter the cell cycle and nir irradiation led to a slight decrease in the number of cells due to photothermal cell death which is analogous to the live dead cell assay treatments with free dox and ngo dox cpeg induced g m cell cycle arrest in the cell lines with significant decreases in the number of live cells nir irradiation introduced further decreases in the number of live cells and this cycle pattern is consistent with the results presented in figures a and a showing reproducibility of the anticancer effects figure a live dead assay and b cycle analysis of pc du and lncap cells from treatments with ngo cpeg and ngo dox cpeg flakes including free dox with or without nir irradiation scale bar m cpeg chitosan polyethylene glycol dox doxorubicin ngo nanodimensional graphene oxide nir near infrared full figure and legend k the in vivo biodistribution of free cy fluorescent probe and ngo cy cpeg is presented in figure a the contours of cy concentration as a function of elapsed time after an i v showed a tumor accumulation of ngo cy cpeg but this trend was not observed for the free cy however there was a re increase in dye concentration from to h which might be due to fluorescence quenching when the dye is distributed deeper in the body under physiological conditions during h following i v free cy and ngo cy cpeg might have been distributed into deeper tissues a longer circulation h then led to the surface appearance of dye which might cause the unusual increase pattern figure a also shows a longer circulation of cy for the ngo cy cpeg than that of the free cy which may be due to the pegylated surface of the flakes that could be helpful to extend the delivery and accumulation of the flakes into targeted tumor tissues the pegylated surface prevents opsonization thus it prolongs the blood circulation time to maintain enhanced fluorescence by ngo cy cpeg free cy is known to be easily degraded and cleared from the body resulting in lower fluorescence the duration for biodistribution analysis was h and the circulation of flakes could reach a higher extent in tumors at an extended time course that is h however the instability of cy limited the evaluation period to h the ex vivo fluorescence of tumors and organs liver lung spleen heart and kidney was subsequently analyzed the free cy case did not exhibit a significant accumulation in the tumor tissues in comparison with other organs figure b a site selective accumulation of cy was clearly observed for the flakes in tumor tissues h after i v which could be an enhanced permeation and retention effect from the pegylation of ngo dox that is cpeg incorporation figure c furthermore some fluorescence was observed even in mouse skin which is consistent with a previous report the fluorescence observed on the organs and tumor was a relative expression that compares fluorescence among the tested organs and tumor only it was not the fluorescence in the circulation or in the skin the easy degradation and clearance of free cy from the body could be proven from the clear accumulation of free cy in the liver and kidneys a nominal accumulation of free cy was also observed in tumors implying that more accumulation of ngo cy cpeg occurred in tumors with a relatively lower accumulation in the liver and kidney from the longer blood circulation and suppressed opsonization resulting in a higher chance of reaching the tumor site in vivo imaging upon i v of ngo dox cpeg flakes to validate a more realistic photothermal effect was performed in a pc xenograft mouse model at h after i v via the tail vein the tumors were irradiated with an nm nir laser w cm for up to min figure d there was no significant thermal elevation for mice treated with saline only in the case of ngo dox cpeg flakes the treated mice presented a significant thermal elevation from to c in the focal region no obvious temperature changes were observed for the non irradiated body parts during the test even though nir light can only penetrate a few millimeters into biological systems the results showed pronounced anticancer effects under nir irradiation that are likely due to the high targeting efficiency of ngo dox cpeg however in an actual clinical situation it would be challenging to apply enough nir energy to tumor sites located deep inside the body a potential suitable approach for such conditions is the use of minimally invasive surgical tools a combination of advanced electronics and fluorescence labeled nanosystems can enable fluorescence based mapping ph sensing and localized photo chemotherapy for efficient cancer treatments figure a in vivo biodistribution of ngo dox cpeg in pc tumor xenograft mice circle represents tumor area contours concentration distribution extracted from individual organs with b free cy and c ngo cy cpeg are shown d in vivo photothermal imaging upon nir laser irradiation on tumors of mice pretreated with saline or ngo dox cpeg cpeg chitosan polyethylene glycol cy cyanin dox doxorubicin ngo nanodimensional graphene oxide nir near infrared full figure and legend k on the basis of the in vitro assessments we attempted to verify the anticancer activity of the assembled ngo dox cpeg flakes using an in vivo mouse xenograft model following subcutaneous tumor injection pc cells and growth up to mm treatment with free dox and the flakes was performed via tail vein injections nir irradiation at the tumor site was used to determine the chemothermal effects on tumor inhibition compared with the control and free dox groups the ngo dox cpeg flakes remarkably facilitated the inhibition of tumor growth which was further suppressed by nir irradiation at the tumor site after a day treatment the antitumor activity was in the order of ngo dox cpeg nir ngo dox cpeg dox when they were compared with the untreated control figure a the safety profiles of the free dox and flakes were analyzed by measuring body weights figure b mice treated with the control and free dox groups showed body weight losses of and respectively whereas no clear correlations were found between the number of treatment days and weight loss for the ngo dox cpeg and ngo dox cpeg nir groups in the control group the results might be attributed to metastases of the tumor cells that possibly affected multiple organs in mice thereby inducing clear weight losses the results for the free dox group could be related to the previously reported toxicities that cause weight loss in mice such as cardiotoxicity neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity unlike the control and free dox groups the enhanced anticancer effects and reduced toxicities from application of the ngo dox cpeg flakes supplementary figure s led to accumulation and efficient delivery of dox to tumor sites which may be due to the sustained release and prolonged circulation in the bloodstream and the enhanced permeation and retention effect in addition histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on the tumor masses to determine the expression levels of caspase parp cd and ki figure c supplementary table s the tumor cell volumes after ngo dox cpeg treatment were significantly smaller than those of free dox and the volumes were further reduced by nir irradiation the expression of apoptotic markers caspase and parp was more clearly illustrated for ngo dox cpeg and ngo dox cpeg nir treated tumors than those for the control and free dox treated groups whereas a reverse tendency was found for cd an angiogenesis marker and ki a tumor proliferation marker because of the enhanced accumulation of the fully nanodimensional flakes followed by dox release at the tumor sites these results indicated that the anticancer effects of the flakes were better than those of free dox and that nir irradiation further enhanced prostate cancer treatment due to chemothermal activity figure a

polyethylene glycol cy cyanin dox doxorubicin ngo nanodimensional graphene oxide nir near infrared parp poly adp ribose polymerase full figure and legend k as a core portion of desired nanoplatforms ngo dox flakes were conveniently assembled in a single pass gas phase condition they were incorporated with cpeg to form ngo dox cpeg flakes in an on demand configuration for nir induced anticancer therapy the ngo flakes exhibited high and stable dox loading capacity and ph dependent drug release profiles for cancer treatment measurements of the in vitro cellular uptake and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells demonstrated the effectiveness of ngo dox cpeg flakes which introduced the combined effects of dox release and hyperthermia under nir irradiation in vivo study revealed that the fully lateral nanodimensional systems could enhance accumulation at the tumor sites to activate sustained release and prolonged circulation with enhanced permeation and retention for improved antitumor effects and safety thus the proposed approach may enable the on demand continuous assembly and modification of fresh multimodal nanoplatforms for use in various drug delivery systems including
