# Math of Intelligence - Weekly Challenge Submissions

In this repository are my submissions for Siraj Raval's weekly challenges in [The Math of Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2-dafEMk2A7mu0bSksCGMJEmeddU_H4D) course.

I am honored to have won the "Wizard of the Week" award for my work on [Naive Bayes Classifiers](https://github.com/NoahLidell/math-of-intelligence/blob/master/generative_models/LDA_for_research_trend_discovery.ipynb) [[code](https://github.com/NoahLidell/math-of-intelligence/blob/master/probability_theory/bayesian-classification.ipynb)], [Latent Dirichlet Allocation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79pmNdyxEGo&feature=youtu.be&list=PL2-dafEMk2A7mu0bSksCGMJEmeddU_H4D&t=540) [[code](https://github.com/NoahLidell/math-of-intelligence/blob/master/generative_models/LDA_for_research_trend_discovery.ipynb)], [Q Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhtnECml-KI&feature=youtu.be&list=PL2-dafEMk2A7mu0bSksCGMJEmeddU_H4D&t=552) [[code](https://github.com/NoahLidell/math-of-intelligence/blob/master/q_learning/cartpole_cnn_qlearning.ipynb)], and I got runner up for my work on [Bayesian Optimization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyuBTMaKFmU&feature=youtu.be&list=PL2-dafEMk2A7mu0bSksCGMJEmeddU_H4D&t=514) [[code](https://github.com/NoahLidell/math-of-intelligence/blob/master/hyperparameter_optimization/bayesian_optimization_for_nn_based_lin_reg_of_BTC_price_data.ipynb)] of a neural network learning rate.
