    "For this week's challenge I decided to put some effort towards finding a novel text dataset and dabble in a little data mining. After bumming around the internet for a while I found my target: **Nature.com**\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as I know nature.com does not provide any API service for programmatically accessing their content. While they have been nice enough to make some paper \"open access\", which means they are free to download as a PDF or view in browser as html, there's no way I am gonna point click drag copy paste through at least a hundred of webpage to get the volumn of data I would like for this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, python is good for more than data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "And with a url as straight forward as this:\n",
    "`https://www.nature.com/search?article_type=protocols,research,reviews&subject=biotechnology&page=3`\n",
    "who needs an api? \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two python files in this folder that I used to scrape research papers off nature.com for use in the this notebook's dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first script, `collect-article-html.py`, plugs different [keywords](https://www.nature.com/subjects) in the `&subject=` placeholder in the url and goes through the first eight pages of search results. Each search result page's html is loaded into an html parser (lxml) and the link and title for all 25 articles on the results page is accessed through the xpath for their respective html elements. All article links found are followed and the raw page html for the research paper document is saved in a database (mysql) along with the articles title, date, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "I ran this `collect-article-html.py` repeatedly across 32 different searchable keywords and in a few hours pulled down over 3000 research papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second script, `process-html.py`, pulls the raw html for every article downloaded. Filtering the research paper text out of the html document proved easier than I expected. I used the BeautifulSoup4 library to removal all the html tags and then with just the page text leftover it was as easy as telling python to only keep the text after the \"Abstract\" substring and before the \"References\" substring. Additional text preprocessing was doing in this script, removing all special characters, numbers, and excess whitespace.  \n",

      "\t evaporative drying ed is an alternative technique for long term preservation of mammalian sperm which does not require liquid nitrogen or freeze drying equipment but offers advantages for storage and shipping at ambient temperature and low cost however the development of zygotes generated from these sperms was poor here we demonstrated that the supplementation of tauroursodeoxycholic acid tudca an endogenous bile acid during embryo culture improved the developmental competency of embryos derived from in vitro matured pig oocytes injected intracytoplasmically with boar ed spermatozoa by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species the dna degradation and fragmentation and the expression of apoptosis related gene bax and bak and by increasing the transcription of anti apoptosis gene bcl xl and bcl furthermore tudca treatment promoted the blastocyst quality manifested by the total cell numbers and the ratio of inner cell mass taken together our data suggest that evaporative drying would be a potentially useful method for the routine preservation of boar sperm in combination with further optimization of subsequently embryo culture conditions introduction long term preservation of mammalian sperm has widespread applications in medicine and agriculture including facilitating treatment of human infertility and fertility preservation for male cancer patients artificial insemination and thus genetic improvement of livestock conservation of endangered species and maintenance of genetic diversity while cryopreservation of mammalian sperm in liquid nitrogen ln has been successfully employed the ability to preserve sperm at much higher temperatures ideally at ambient temperature is preferred for a number of reasons it would dramatically reduce the storage expenses facilitate sample transport while reducing associated costs and prevent cross contamination between samples stored in ln intracytoplasmic sperm injection icsi an in vitro fertilization procedure in which a single sperm is injected directly into an egg has truly revolutionized not only the treatment options for couples with impaired semen quality and those with both obstructive and non obstructive azoospermia but also the methods of long term sperm storage which just need to protect sperm dna from physical damage irrespective of sperm motility or integrity of sperm membrane correspondingly the new approaches such as freeze drying and evaporative drying can long term preserve mouse spermatozoa without using ln or dry ice for storage and transportation furthermore the method of evaporative drying also has an advantage over that of freeze drying since the former does not need freeze drying apparatus during sample preparation however whether the method of evaporative drying available for practical use in other animals especially in swine which serves as a well recognized model for biomedicine research needed further studies preimplantation embryos are extremely sensitive to oxidative stress for a rapid growth and differentiation embryos need to produce more energy through electron transport chain in the mitochondria with atp production reactive oxygen species ros are also created as by products in the mitochondria in the normal physical condition the production of ros is sensitively controlled by the balance of oxidizing and reducing substances and these related enzymes accumulating evidence has shown that imbalance of oxidation and reduction leads to oxidative stress which causes the developmental arrest physical dna damage impaired expression profile of several anti and pro apoptotic members of the bcl family apoptosis and embryo fragmentation thus ros homeostasis is one of the key factors to keep embryo healthy on the other hand tauroursodeoxycholic acid tudca is an endogenous bile acid synthesized in the liver conjugation pathway of ursodeoxycholic acid udca which is an fda approved molecule widely used in treatment of liver diseases and served as a potent inhibitor of apoptosis several reports have shown that tudca is an orally bioavailable and effective inhibitor of apoptosis by exhibiting antioxidant properties maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential and preventing cytochrome c release bax translocation caspase activation during mitochondrial pathway of cell death as well as endoplasmic reticulum stress mediated cell death in central nervous system and in liver since vitrification of sperm has been shown to be closely associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species ros and apoptotic events it is tempting to speculate that addition of antioxidant tudca during embryo culture to reduce the levels of ros in embryos derived from evaporative drying spermatozoa can improve the poor outcome following icsi therefore our objectives were to determine the feasibility that preservation of boar sperm through evaporative drying technique the effects of supplementation of antioxidant tudca during embryo culture on the developmental competency of embryos derived from in vitro matured porcine oocyte injected with evaporative drying boar sperm our results demonstrate that tudca treatment increased the development and the quality of embryos from spermatozoa evaporatively dried in swine resultsoptimal tudca supplementation improved the preimplantation development following porcine cumulus oocyte complexes cocs maturation in vitro and icsi of evaporative drying boar spermsto evaluate the feasibility that storage of boar sperm through evaporative drying technique we examined the development of embryos derived by icsi of evaporatively dried spermatozoa following porcine cocs maturation in vitro compared to control embryos derived by icsi of conventional cryopreservation spermatozoa following porcine cocs maturation in vitro the cleavage rate vs p and the percentages of blastocyst vs p were significantly lower in the group of embryos generated using evaporatively dried spermatozoa table to test whether reducing ros by adding antioxidant tudca in the embryo culture medium increases the developmental competency of embryos derived from evaporative drying spermatozoa we cultured embryos supplemented with or m tudca respectively as shown in table m tudca could dramatically enhance the percentage of cell cell morula and blastocyst embryos when compared to other tudca treated groups and m tudca respectively n p although embryos derived from evaporative drying spermatozoa in the m tudca treatment group had less developmental competency as regards the rate of cell embryo morula and blastocyst than these of embryos generated using cryopreserved spermatozoa without tudca treatment n p m tudca supplementation significantly

of ros and apoptosisto assess how does tudca increase the embryo development and quality we first compared the levels of ros in embryos generated using evaporatively dried spermatozoa with or without m tudca treatment and embryos derived from cryopreserved spermatozoa as shown in fig d the levels of ros were comparable between embryos generated using evaporatively dried spermatozoa without tudca treatment n and embryos derived from cryopreserved spermatozoa n while m tudca treatment significantly decreased the ros levels in the embryos generated using evaporatively dried spermatozoa n compared to those of using either cryopreserved spermatozoa or evaporative drying spermatozoa without tudca treatment n p since high level of ros has been shown to be closely associated with apoptotic events we then tested the transcript levels of genes involved in apoptosis our results demonstrated that the expression of proapoptosis genes bax and bak was significantly lower in embryos generated using cryopreserved spermatozoa group than that in embryos derived from evaporatively dried spermatozoa without tudca treatment as expected m tudca dramatically reduced the expression of bax and bak in embryos derived from evaporatively dried spermatozoa to a level that was even lower than that in embryos generated using cryopreserved spermatozoa n p on the other hand the expression levels of anti apoptosis genes bcl xl and bcl were comparable between embryos derived from evaporatively dried spermatozoa without tudca treatment and embryos generated using cryopreserved spermatozoa more interestingly m tudca dramatically increased the expression of bcl xl and bcl in the embryo generated using evaporatively dried spermatozoa n p fig finally we detected the effect of tudca on the occurrence of apoptosis in the embryos derived from evaporatively dried spermatozoa with tunel assay and embryo fragmentation as shown in fig both tunel n vs n and fragmentation n vs n index were significantly lower in embryos generated using cryopreserved spermatozoa than that in embryos derived from evaporatively dried spermatozoa without tudca treatment consistently m tudca dramatically cut

results demonstrate that zygotes derived by icsi of evaporatively dried boar spermatozoa following porcine cocs maturation in vitro developed to blastocyst less frequently than controls derived by icsi of conventional cryopreservation spermatozoa we predicted that the sperm damage caused by evaporative drying interferes with the physical dna damage and embryo fragmentation which makes the subsequent embryos vulnerable to oxidative stress in fact we found that the supplementation of antioxidant tudca during embryo culture enhanced the developmental competency of embryos derived from evaporative drying spermatozoa in a dose dependent manner through decreasing the production of ros and the occurrence of apoptosis our results suggest that the preservation of boar sperm through evaporative drying technique is feasible when combination with further optimization of subsequently embryo culture conditions because of its ease of application and cost effectiveness evaporative drying has been considered an attractive alternative to traditional methods for preserving wild and genetically modified mouse spermatozoa on a variety of genetic backgrounds including bcf cbl and fvb n to date however there have been few studies to validate the use of evaporative drying technology to preserve store and recover boar spermatozoa earlier studies have shown that residual centrosomes of spermatozoa play different roles for the reconstruction of the zygotic centrosome after fertilization between non rodent and rodent mammals in rodents sperm centrioles degenerate during spermatogenesis and the sperm brings little or no centrosome material into the egg at fertilization whereas in pigs and other non rodent mammals sperm centrioles are not completely lost and so the sperm delivers one intact and one partially degenerate centriole to the egg at fertilization thus porcine ova cannot be fertilized as soon as the evaporatively dried boar sperm is injected unless beside a kda protein phospholipase c zeta which is necessary to activate mammalian eggs the activity of centrosomes of boar spermatozoa is not destroyed by evaporative drying it is well known that in vitro embryonic development could be disturbed by high oxygen concentration which imposes deteriorative microenvironment on preimplantation embryos through increasing the production of ros moreover some researchers showed that species specific blocks to embryonic development could be induced by the rise of hydrogen peroxide levels attributable to in vitro culture this effect of oxidative stress can be weakened by efficient antioxidant agents such as catalase or superoxide dismutase as well as thiol compounds acting as metabolic buffers which scavenge active oxygen species in most cells castro et al reported that tudca can directly inhibit the production of reactive oxygen species eliminate the transmembrane potential and keep the outer mitochondrial membrane intact consistently our data demonstrated that antioxidant tudca can lower the contents of reactive oxygen species ros decrease the dna degradation and fragmentation as well as apoptosis through optimizing the expression of apoptosis related genes bax and bak and anti apoptosis genes bcl xl and bcl in porcine embryo in vitro as a result the quality of blastocyst was improved indicated as total cell number and the percentage of inner cell mass on the other hand ros function as essential signal transducers regulating the normal cellular physiology including the cellular gene expression pattern the developmental breakdown of cellular organelles during differentiation or cell maturation and biotransformation of xenobiotics our data also indicated that supplementation of extremely high concentration of tudca like m during embryo culture posed a potential hazard in the preimplantation developmental competency in swine manifested by a lower rate of cleavage and blastocyst embryo when compared to m tudca supplementation thus our data suggest that optimal addition of antioxidant reagents during embryo culture could be beneficial for the development of mammalian embryos derived from evaporatively dried spermatozoa in addition apoptosis is regarded as a side effect of in vitro culture of embryos in bovine and porcine however porcine blastocysts produced in vivo have little or no apoptotic dna fragmentation therefore the degree of apoptosis in blastocysts can be used as an indicator for the effectiveness and suitability of the culture condition for embryo development materials and methods

kit bio rad hercules ca as described previously each cdna sample was processed for pcr amplification by denaturation at c for min followed by to cycles at c for s c for s and c for s and final extension at c for min the primers used for rt pcr are given in table after pcr amplifications the pcr products were applied to agarose gel electrophoresis in tae buffer and visualized with ethidium bromide staining the intensity of each band was quantified and the relative intensity against gapdh in the same lane was calculated by using imagequant ge healthcare table primers used for rt pcr analyses full size tableassays for intracellular ros levels in embryosthe intracellular ros levels of blastocyst were evaluated with image it live green reactive oxygen species detection kit invitrogen eugene oregon according to the manufacturers instructions briefly day blastocysts were incubated with tert butyl hydroperoxide tbhp for h to induce intracellular ros production the blastocysts were then stained with and carboxy dichlorodihydrofluoresceindiacetate carboxy hdcfda for min and analyzed the intracellular ros level under fluorescence microscope te u nikon japan imagej software u national institutes of health usa was used for quantitative analysis of fluorescent intensity of each embryo background taken just outside the cells was subtracted from each image tunel assayapoptotic cells in the blastocysts were detected by using in situ cell death detection kit roche diagnostics indianapolis in day blastocysts were fixed with paraformaldehyde in pbs ph for h at room temperature subsequently the fixed blastocysts were permeabilized with triton x and sodium citrate in pbs for h followed three times wash in pbs containing pva at room temperature then blastocysts were incubated with fluorescein conjugated dutp and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase according to the manufactuers instruction in the dark for h at c after thorough rinse embryos were counterstained with dapi diamidino phenylindole and mounted in the mounting medium vectashield vector laboratories inc burlingame ca the number of total and apoptotic cells in each embryo were counted using scanning laser confocal microscope lsm live carl zeiss jena germany apoptotic cells presenting pink color which were double stained with tunel red signal and dapi blue signal non apoptotic cells and fragmented nuclear were labeled with dapi and appeared blue the apoptotic and fragmentation index was calculated for each embryo as follows apoptotic index number of tunel positive nuclei total number of nuclei in blastocyst fragmentation index number of fragmented cell total number of cell in blastocyst statistical analysisresults were analyzed by using spss software for each experiment at
